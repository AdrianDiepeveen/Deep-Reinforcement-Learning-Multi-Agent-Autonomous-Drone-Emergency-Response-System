# Deep-Q-Learning-Multi-Agent-Autonomous-Drone-Emergency-Response-System
This system was developed with 2 pipelines, namely: 1. Deep Q-Learning. 2. Q-Learning. Only numerical libraries were utilised in the development of the neural network logic to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the architectures.
